# PyV8PseudoAPI
PyV8 is python wrapper of V8 JavaScript engine. It interpretates JavaScript sources and execute them, then send the result to python. However, PyV8 cannot do anything because prepared operating system's application program interfaces are none. The script written with JavaScript, for instance, Locky, Zepto, RAA ransomwares' file I/O operation are no use in trying. So This repository provides the dummy OS API the script can be connected to. 

Dummy APIs is supported to OS belonges to. Two versions exist. 
1. Print the executable functions' arguments out.
2. Including '1', real JavaScript operation in functions execute! (It can be regarded as a malware... So it is recommend to use in virtual environments.)  
It's been prepared. I hope you guys to support me later.
